When I was in high school, I was interested in physics, especially electromagnetics and I got bronze medal in National Physics Olympiad. Therefore, I chose electrical engineering as my major in BSc. However, after a while, I found that I'm more interested in signal processing and probability and their intersection which is statistical signal processing. So, I pursued my education in MSc in the field of machine learning and its applications in speech signal processing. Meanwhile, I started studying Prof. Bishop's inspiring <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/">book</a> and I got mad at probabilistic modeling and Bayesian learning.

During my Master's program, I worked in Multimedia Signal Processing Research Lab at Amirkabir University of Technology with a group of three researchers under the supervision of Prof. Hamid Sheikhzadeh. We published one journal paper in Elsevier and several conference papers. We studied and used mixture models like GMMs and sequence modeling techniques such as HMMs and linear dynamical systems for the voice conversion task. Moreover, we did extensive research on speech analysis/synthesis methods and spectral features e.g. MFCC, LSF and MCC.

Next, I decided to apply my AI knowledge to more practical problems in the industry, so I did some freelance projects including human gesture recognition using the Kinect sensor by HMM. After a while, I got my first AI job as a natural language processing researcher and engineer. The task was multi-label text classification, which I did using LSTM and deep learning using pre-trained word2vec models. Then, I moved to MAPNA group. In MAPNA, We have designed and implemented several anomaly detection models based on GANs and Variational AutoEncoders to distinguish the normal behavior of a plant from its faulty behavior.
