When I was in high school, I was interested in physics, especially electromagnetics and I got bronze medal in National Physics Olympiad. Therefore, I chose electrical engineering as my major in BSc. However, after a while, I found that I was more interested in signal processing and probability and their intersection which is statistical signal processing. So, I pursued my education in MSc in the field of machine learning and its applications in speech signal processing. Meanwhile, I started studying Prof. Bishop's inspiring <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/">book</a> and I became keen on probabilistic modeling and Bayesian learning.

During my Master's program, I worked in a lab at Amirkabir University of Technology with a group of three researchers under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tLX51p0AAAAJ&hl=en">Hamid Sheikhzadeh</a>. We published one journal paper in Elsevier and several conference papers. We studied and used mixture models like GMMs, sequence modeling techniques such as HMMs and linear dynamical systems for the voice conversion task. Moreover, we did extensive research on speech analysis/synthesis and features extraction methods. After graduation I continued my research with the lab and I also extended my knowledge of python and linux.

Next, I decided to apply my AI knowledge to more practical problems in the industry and after a while, I got my first AI job as a natural language processing engineer. The task was multi-label text classification, which I did using LSTM and word2vec models.
Next, I moved to MAPNA group where I got interested in representation learning and transfer learning. We obtained meaningful and disentangled representations of power plantâ€™s high dimensional sensor data which is very useful for fault classification. We also employed GANs and Variational AutoEncoders to adapt trained models to new and unseen environmental conditions.

Recently, I joined <a href="https://bama.ir/">bama.ir</a>. Bama is the leading car advertisement company in Iran and therefore we have millions of car adverts with people's suggested prices on them. We're working on diverse machine learning techniques to build a used cars price estimation model. This is a regression task with a car's age, mileage, body status and other attributes (about 10 in total) as input and its estimated price as output. We are facing many challenges including robustness of models to outliers and feature engineering. Injecting domain (expert) knowledge into the models is another issue we are tackling. Altogether, I love this intriguing task!
