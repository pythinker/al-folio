I’m a machine learning researcher with backgrounds in physics and electrical engineering. These days, I work as a ML researcher at MAPNA Group. I have 8+ years experience studying and developing diverse machine learning algorithms with applications in natural language processing, anomaly detection and speech processing. I’m Enthusiastic about the mathematics behind machine learning and passionate about open-source technologies especially Linux, python and R markdown (by which I’ve built this website!).

I hold a MS degree in communication systems from Amirkabir University of Technology. During my MS program, I dealt with different aspects of speech processing, including voice conversion, speech recognition and speaker verification. I’ve published several academic papers about voice conversion. My first experience of machine learning in industry was natural language processing but I changed my path soon and it’s about three years that I work as a machine learning researcher for the condition monitoring of power plants.
