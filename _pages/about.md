Machine Learning Researcher @ MAPNA Group <br/><br/>

<p align="justify">
Welcome! Iâ€™m Mostafa, a machine learning enthusiast. I completed my BSc and MSc both in electrical engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology in 2011 and 2013. I won the bronze medal in National Physics Olympiad, when I was in high school. I'm ranked 168th among 90,000 members in <a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/users/51209">Data Science Stack Exchange</a>. My research interests center around deep generative models and representation learning. More specifically, I've focused on Variational AutoEncoders and GANs and their application in dimensionality reduction and domain adaptation. for more details, see my <a href="/bio">bio</a>.
